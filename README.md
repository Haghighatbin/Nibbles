# Welcome to Besty's Saga

Rules are simple:

Betsy hits the boundries, she'll lose!
She hits herself, she'll lose!
She hits the fence, she'll be electrocuted, she'll lose!
She eats 30 apples and she'll see a hole to a whole new level.

BTW, Betsy talks too much, and sometimes she's rude, you can mute her voice by clicking on the icon on top right.
