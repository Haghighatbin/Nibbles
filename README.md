Rules are simple:

- Betsy hits the boundries, she'll lose!<br />
- She hits herself, she'll lose!<br />
- She hits the fence, she'll be electrocuted, she'll lose!<br />
- She eats 30 apples and she'll see a hole to a whole new level.<br />

BTW, Betsy talks too much, and sometimes she's rude, you may mute her voice and the theme song by clicking on the icons on top right.<br />
Enjoy!<br />
